# sanctuary

In the current political climate, local and state governments across the country
have become self-declared sanctuaries for migrants and have declared an unwillingness
to conform to aggressive federal enforcement of immigration laws in order to protect vulnerable
communities.

This web app intends to partly address that issue by allow users a platform to upvote or downvote cities given a declared status.

No test suite is currently included.

run bundle install to grab the required gems and rake db:seed to try out some test data(provided by the faker gem so it's fictitious)

launch your server, rails s and you are good to go.
